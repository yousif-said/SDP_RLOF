Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Pipeline with Anthropic HH Data
Overview
This repository demonstrates the process of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a cutting-edge technique used to align language models with human values and preferences. RLHF has been popularized by models like OpenAI‚Äôs InstructGPT and ChatGPT, where human feedback guides the model to produce safer, more helpful, and more contextually appropriate responses.

In this example, we focus on a critical step of the RLHF pipeline: training a reward model that can score responses according to human preferences. Once this reward model is established, it can be used in a policy optimization loop (e.g., using Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) to refine the behavior of a large language model.

What is RLHF?
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a framework for aligning large language models with human expectations and ethical guidelines. The process typically involves:

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Start from a pretrained language model and fine-tune it on instruction-following data. At this stage, the model learns to produce helpful responses but may still generate undesirable outputs.

Human Feedback Collection & Reward Modeling: Humans compare two candidate responses from the model and choose the one they prefer. These comparisons are used to train a reward model that predicts how "good" or "aligned" a response is, given a particular prompt.

Policy Optimization (e.g., PPO): Using the reward model as a guiding signal, we apply reinforcement learning to further adjust the model‚Äôs parameters so that it consistently produces high-reward responses. The reward model effectively replaces the manual feedback collection after initial training, making the entire process scalable.

What Does This Code Do?
In this repository, we:

Load and Format Data: We use the Anthropic HH dataset, which contains pairs of responses to a prompt along with human preferences indicating which response is better (less harmful, more helpful, etc.). We format the dataset so that each example has a "prompt", a "chosen" response, and a "rejected" response.

Train a Reward Model: We fine-tune a GPT-2-based model to predict the preference between two responses. Given (prompt, chosen_response) and (prompt, rejected_response), the model learns to give a higher "score" (logit) to the chosen response. We use a pairwise comparison loss:

loss
=
‚àí
log
‚Å°
(
ùúé
(
ùëü
chosen
‚àí
ùëü
rejected
)
)
loss=‚àílog(œÉ(r 
chosen
‚Äã
 ‚àír 
rejected
‚Äã
 ))
where 
ùëü
chosen
r 
chosen
‚Äã
  and 
ùëü
rejected
r 
rejected
‚Äã
  are the model‚Äôs scalar rewards for chosen and rejected responses respectively.

Benchmarking on a Holdout Set: After training on the first 1,000 examples, we test the reward model on a held-out slice (e.g., examples [1000:1500]) to measure how often it prefers the correct (human-chosen) response over the rejected one. This provides a measure of how well the model learned human preferences.

WandB Integration: We use Weights & Biases (WandB) to log the training loss and the final holdout accuracy. This allows you to visualize progress, keep track of experiments, and compare runs over time.

Why is This Important?
Training a reward model is a critical step in RLHF. Once we have a stable reward model that can accurately predict human preferences, we can "close the loop" by using reinforcement learning to optimize the base language model. The RL stage uses the reward model‚Äôs output as a training signal, guiding the policy model (the generative language model) to produce more aligned and preferable outputs.

In other words:

Without a reliable reward model, RLHF cannot scale.
The reward model turns human annotations (which are expensive and time-consuming to collect) into a reusable training signal.
Extending This Approach
Beyond Harmlessness: Toxicity and Other Dimensions
While this example focuses on "harmlessness" as per the Anthropic HH dataset, the methodology can be extended to any human-defined preference or label. For instance:

Toxic vs. Non-Toxic Responses: If you have a dataset where humans label responses as "toxic" or "non-toxic," you could structure these as comparisons and train a reward model that prefers non-toxic responses.

python
Copy code
# Example: For a toxicity dataset
# prompt: "User asked a question"
# chosen: "A helpful, neutral answer"
# rejected: "A toxic or hateful response"
# The reward model then learns to assign higher scores to neutral, helpful responses.
Factually Correct vs. Incorrect: Using a dataset where humans mark answers as factually correct or incorrect, the reward model can learn to favor responses grounded in accurate information.

Style Preferences: If you want a model to adopt a certain writing style (formal vs. informal, concise vs. verbose), you can provide pairs of responses with human annotations indicating which style is preferred.

Integrating RL with PPO
Currently, this code only trains a reward model. The full RLHF pipeline involves the next step:

Initialize a policy model (e.g., a model fine-tuned on instructions).
Generate candidate responses for the training prompts.
Use the reward model to score these responses.
Compute a reinforcement learning update (e.g., using PPO) that adjusts the policy to produce higher-reward responses.
The TRL library (Hugging Face) can facilitate the PPO step:

python
Copy code
from trl import PPOTrainer, PPOConfig
# After loading a policy model (e.g., GPT-2) and a reference model, as well as having the reward model:
ppo_config = PPOConfig(
    batch_size=16,
    forward_batch_size=4,
    # additional PPO config parameters...
)
ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(config=ppo_config, model=policy_model, ref_model=ref_model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Pseudocode for PPO step:
responses = policy_model.generate(prompts)
rewards = [reward_model.predict(prompt, response) for prompt, response in zip(prompts, responses)]
train_stats = ppo_trainer.step(prompts, responses, rewards)
After enough PPO iterations, the policy model should produce responses that align better with human preferences, as encoded by the reward model.

Hardware Considerations
GPU Acceleration: Training these models often requires a GPU for reasonable performance. If you do not have a GPU, consider using smaller models (like GPT-2) and smaller batch sizes.
Scaling Up: For larger models (like LLaMA or GPT-NeoX), consider techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), 8-bit quantization (BitsAndBytes), or distributed training.

Conclusion
This repository shows the initial steps of RLHF: training a reward model on human preference data and evaluating it. With a well-trained reward model, you can move on to the reinforcement learning stage, using PPO or another algorithm to improve your policy model. This process ensures that large language models behave more in line with human values and produce safer, more helpful responses.
